# How to run the notebooks in Google Colab

The easiest way to open the colab notebooks is by simply clicking on the links to the notebooks on the landing page of this repository (README.md).

Alternatively there is another approach over colab.research.google.com directly.

For this you need to login to your Google account.

Go to the URL: **https://colab.research.google.com/github/**

A webpage will open like this:

Then click search or press Enter. The widget will display the notebooks in the repository.

You are now set to run the notebook:

or

- Go to **Runtime** menu at the top and click on **Run all** to run all cells.
